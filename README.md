AlgorithmsAndDataStructures2023_Practice_Snippets

I've added some general notes regarding Data Structures and Algorightms as a refresher for myself, and anyone else who could benefit from it

Ref : (all these are mentioned in this course, but I wish the course had the code snippets, so I looked for them and put them in this repository)

The above is a super useful resource and you can just 'audit' the course as well , for free !
